This is a simple todo app in express js.
Since I have been using express for a while i decided to perfect the skilll even more.
From this project I have learnt to use clusters and workr threads and also learnt the difference that clusters allow the server to be run cocurrently on different cores or logical cpu while worker threads just make the instance of the same code in the same file.
I have learnt to do this using the pm2 library which is very handy in helping one to manage processes.
Also from the project I have gotten experience scripting with mpm and boosting my productivity.
Finally I have also learnt how to use mongodb as a database knew it before bt i havvenow gotten better understanding of it.
Also generally i have learnt hoe to apply node best practices on my projects that i will probably use from now on.
